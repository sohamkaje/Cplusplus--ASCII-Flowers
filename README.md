# Cplusplus--ASCII-Flowers
This program will ask the user for a number. 
It will then incorporate that number and make a floral pattern with that number of heads (each head will expand by one dot and row on both sides, making each head bigger than the last).
The program will also design a lengthy stem dependent on the user's input.
